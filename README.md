# SEO Checklist

One project is to create a SEO checklist for fictitious German based furniture Startup "Chillomania".
There are 3 major categories namely- Technical, Content and Off page SEO

I have also created a foundation category which covers a few basic tools that need to be incorporated to make plugins and analysis easier.

Technical SEO: Learn about foundational elements of a website that impacts user experience and search engine crawlers.  
Content SEO: Learn how to create and organize high quality and relevant content that align with user intent and search engine algorithms.
Off Page SEO: Learn how to build online presence and relevance beyond the website.

**Layout:**

Priority Levels: The checklist is organized by priority levels (High, Medium, Low) to guide the order of implementation. This helps in focusing on critical aspects first.
Each checklist item is concise and specific, making it easy to understand and act upon. The items are actionable and cover key aspects of SEO.
Tool/Website for Analysis: Providing links to tools or websites for analysis ensures that users have easy access to resources for implementing each checklist item.
